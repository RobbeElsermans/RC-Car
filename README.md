code and files for my Tamiya Monster beetle

I'm refreshing my Tamiyan monster beetle with new 3D printed parts.
The transmitter is lost by the years so I'm making a new "experimental" one.

Sadly my gearbox broke (a couple of times with 3D printed gear. maybe I'll try carbon or even hard TPU for more durability) so I'm planning on redesigning the gearbox.
